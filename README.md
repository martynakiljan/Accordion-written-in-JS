The task was: An accordion written with pure JavaScript.

* only 1 top accordion & 1 sub-accordion can be open at the same time

* SVG icons

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough
